{"name":"DataTransferKit","tagline":"A library for multiphysics solution transfer.","body":"The Data Transfer Kit (DTK) is an open-source software library designed to provide parallel services for solution transfer for\r\nmultiphysics simulations <http://www.casl.gov/Infrastructure.shtml>. DTK uses a general operator design to provide scalable parallel services for solution transfer between shared volumes and surfaces. DTK is supported and used by the following Department of Energy multiphysics modeling and simulation programs:\r\n\r\n* Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors (CASL)\r\n  <http://www.casl.gov>\r\n\r\n* National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)\r\n  <http://batterysim.org>\r\n\r\n* Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation (NEAMS)\r\n  <http://www.ne.anl.gov/NEAMS/>\r\n\r\n\r\nDataTransferKit Development Team\r\n================================\r\n\r\nDTK is developed and maintained by:\r\n\r\n* Stuart Slattery <slatterysr@ornl.gov>\r\n\r\n* Damien Lebrun-Grandie <lebrungrandt@ornl.gov>\r\n\r\n* Roger Pawlowski <rppawlo@sandia.gov>\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestions, Bug Reporting, and Issue Tracking\r\n============================================\r\n\r\nQuestions, bug reporting and issue tracking are provided by\r\nGitHub.
