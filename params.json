{"name":"DataTransferKit","tagline":"A library for multiphysics solution transfer.","body":"The Data Transfer Kit (DTK) is an open-source software library\r\ndesigned to provide parallel services for solution transfer for\r\nmultiphysics simulations. DTK uses a general operator design to\r\nprovide scalable parallel services for solution transfer between\r\nshared volumes and surfaces. DTK is supported and used by the\r\nfollowing Department of Energy multiphysics modeling and simulation\r\nprograms:\r\n\r\n* Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors (CASL)\r\n  <http://www.casl.gov>\r\n\r\n* National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)\r\n  <http://batterysim.org>\r\n\r\n* Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation (NEAMS)\r\n  <http://www.ne.anl.gov/NEAMS/>\r\n\r\n\r\nDataTransferKit Development Team\r\n================================\r\n\r\nDTK is developed and maintained by:\r\n\r\n* Stuart Slattery <slatterysr@ornl.gov>\r\n\r\n* Damien Lebrun-Grandie <lebrungrandt@ornl.gov>\r\n\r\n* Roger Pawlowski <rppawlo@sandia.gov>\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestions, Bug Reporting, and Issue Tracking\r\n============================================\r\n\r\nQuestions, bug reporting and issue tracking are provided by\r\nGitHub.
